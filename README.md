Thank you for getting to this point. This repository was created for a project to learn PHP. [Complete Modern PHP Developer Course in 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-modern-php-developer/)

First step was to setup a local environment to run PHP. Used WSL2, installed PHP. Note that in the tutorial the instructor is using Replit, I decided to setup the environment locally to add more complexity to the process. Used the following resources for the setup:
- [How to set up a PHP development environment on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/setup-a-php-development-environment-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-9193ff28ae83)
- [Setup a Local PHP & MySQL Development Environment using Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://dev.to/jackdarracott/setup-a-local-php-mysql-development-environment-using-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-5b)
